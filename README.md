# Mercury
Mercury Engine

[LOGO]

Mercury is the proprietary game engine utilized by Pied Piper for GAM200 and
GAM250. Mercury was largely created by following TheCherno's "Game Engine" 
tutorial series on YouTube, but over the course of its development has branched
off in order to incorporate specific tools needed by its client.

## Getting Started
Mercury is currently only usable with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

## The Plan
Currently, Mercury is primarily designed to render 2D graphics with OpenGL.
In the future, it will be capable of handling game objects, audio, and
various other features that are common to all commercial game engines.

## Main Features To Come
- Component-based 2D rendering
- Particle System
- UI
- Physics/Collision
- Entity Component System (ECS)
- In-game serialization/deserialization
- Native scripting
- AI
- Audio
